Hydromagnetic modes in spherical domains are an important ingredient of liquid cores of planets, moons or stars, as well as rotating fluid dynamics experiments. These modes are solutions to the linearized rotating magnetohydrodynamic equations that govern electrically conducting fluids under rapid rotation. Limace.jl is a package written in the Julia programming language, based on Galerkin projections of the governing equations onto trial vectors of the velocity and magnetic field. It aims to facilitate the calculation of modes in flexible setups with a high-level interface, whilst remaining computationally performant enough to tackle relevant physical parameters. See Gerick (2025) and Gerick \u0026amp; Livermore (2024) for more details on the model.\nThe code is available on GitHub.\nContact: Felix Gerick\n","date":"30 September 2025","permalink":"https://fgerick.github.io/4dearth/codes/limace/","section":"Codes","summary":"Solve for linear eigenmodes of the rotating magnetohydrodynamics equations in a sphere.","title":"Limace.jl"},{"content":"Numerical codes developed by project researchers.\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://fgerick.github.io/4dearth/codes/","section":"Codes","summary":"","title":"Codes"},{"content":"Latest updates related to the project.\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://fgerick.github.io/4dearth/news/","section":"News","summary":"","title":"News"},{"content":"2025 # Gerick \u0026amp; Mandea.
