Hydromagnetic modes in spherical domains are an important ingredient of liquid cores of planets, moons or stars, as well as rotating fluid dynamics experiments. These modes are solutions to the linearized rotating magnetohydrodynamic equations that govern electrically conducting fluids under rapid rotation. Limace.jl is a package written in the Julia programming language, based on Galerkin projections of the governing equations onto trial vectors of the velocity and magnetic field. It aims to facilitate the calculation of modes in flexible setups with a high-level interface, whilst remaining computationally performant enough to tackle relevant physical parameters. See Gerick (2025) and Gerick \u0026amp; Livermore (2024) for more details on the model.\nThe code is available on GitHub.\nContact: Felix Gerick\n","date":"30 September 2025","permalink":"https://fgerick.github.io/4dearth/codes/limace/","section":"Codes","summary":"Solve for linear eigenmodes of the rotating magnetohydrodynamics equations in a sphere.","title":"Limace.jl"},{"content":"Numerical codes developed by project researchers.\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://fgerick.github.io/4dearth/codes/","section":"Codes","summary":"","title":"Codes"},{"content":"Latest updates related to the project.\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://fgerick.github.io/4dearth/news/","section":"News","summary":"","title":"News"},{"content":"2025 # Gerick \u0026amp; Mandea.

These were derived from Swarm L1B Mag-L OPER data version 0602. Data up to end of April 2023 was used for the 4 monthly and 1 monthly GVOs and data up to end of 2022 for the 12 monthly GVOs. No update of the Oersted, CHAMP, Cryosat-2 or Grace GVOs is provided in this delivery, the latest versions of these legacy missions are still those of the previous release (see associated zip folders for each mission) as there has been no change in the processing scheme.\nEach GVO file includes values for observed field, core field (with estimates of magnetospheric and ionospheric fields removed) and SV (from annual difference of the core field data). The file format follows the Swarm Geomagnetic Virtual Observatories Product Definition, Rev.2B, SW-DS-DTU-GS-004_2-1_GVO_PDD. See Hammer et al. (2021) for full details of the GVO processing algorithm.
