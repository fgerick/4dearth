{{< person
    name="Professor Chris Davies"
    affiliation="University of Leeds"
    img="img/people/davies.jpg"
>}}
I am a Professor of theoretical geophysics, working on the dynamics and evolution of Earth's core and magnetic field. More information can be found on [my website](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see/staff/1225/professor-chris-davies) and our [team website](https://planetarycores.leeds.ac.uk/).

{{< person
    name="Professor Chris Finlay"
    affiliation="Technical University of Denmark"
    img="img/people/finlay.jpg"
>}}
I am Professor of Geomagnetism at DTU Space, Technical University of Denmark. I work with geomagnetic observations, from satellites and ground observatories, using these to study the physical properties and dynamics of Earth's surface and deep interior. In 4D Earth Core+ I will focus on the observational inputs to the project, especially from ESA's Swarm satellites, leading DTU's efforts to derive improved core field models and associated diagnostics on model uncertainties and resolution.

{{< person
    name="Dr Felix Gerick"
    affiliation="University of Leeds"
    img="img/people/gerick.jpg"
>}}
I am a postdoctoral fellow, working on hydromagnetic modes propagating in the Earth's liquid core. Within the project I will improve the existing numerical model and use hydromagnetic modes to infer the base-state of a modelled core. I have been involved in the 4D Earth consortium since its beginning in 2019 as a collaborator and Co-PI. You can find more information on my work on [my website](https://fgerick.github.io/).

{{< person
    name="Dr Nicolas Gillet"
    affiliation="Institut des Sciences de la Terre, CNRS"
    img="img/people/gillet.jpg"
>}}
I am CNRS researcher at the ISTerre laboratory in Grenoble, working on the dynamics within Earth's core from the analysis of geomagnetic observations and numerical simulations of the geodynamo. I am PI of the 4D Earth Core+ project sponsored by ESA. More details can be found on [my website](https://www.isterre.fr/annuaire/pages-web-du-personnel/nicolas-gillet/).

{{< person
    name="Dr Dominique Jault"
    affiliation="Institut des Sciences de la Terre, CNRS"
    img="img/people/jault.jpg"
>}}
I am a CNRS researcher working on the main magnetic field of the Earth and on the dynamics within its fluid core. In 4D Earth Core+, I will work on the visco-magnetic boundary layer separating the bulk of the core from the core surface where magnetic models are available, on the electrical conductivity of the lowermost mantle and of the relative rotation of the solid inner core with respect to the mantle.

    img="img/people/kloss.jpg"
>}}
I am a researcher specializing in geomagnetic field modeling, using magnetic data from low-Earth orbit satellites, such as Swarm. In this project, I will work on geomagnetic datasets and field model products, as well as their related model uncertainty and resolution.

{{< person
    name="Professor Phil Livermore"
    affiliation="University of Leeds"
    img="img/people/livermore.jpg"
>}}
I am Professor of Mathematical Geophysics at the University of Leeds, studying the dynamics of Earth’s core though theoretical, numerical and data-driven approaches.
In 4D Earth core+, I am specifically interested in whether machine learning methods can be used to image core dynamics using satellite observations. More details about my work can be found at [my website](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see/staff/1381/professor-phil-livermore).

{{< person
    name="Professor Jon Mound"
    affiliation="University of Leeds"
    img="img/people/mound.jpg"
>}}
I am a Professor of Global Geophysics, who studies the dynamics of the core and coupling between the fluid and solid regions of Earth's deep interior. For the 4D Earth Core+ project I will be involved in work on how we can use observations of the magnetic field to determine core dynamics. More information on my research can be found at https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see/staff/1436/prof-jon-mound.

{{< person
    name="Professor Nils Olsen"
    affiliation="Technical University of Denmark"
    img="img/people/olsen.jpg"
>}}
I am Professor of Geophysics at DTU Space, Technical University of Denmark. I work with geomagnetic data from satellites and ground observatories, on electromagnetic induction in Earth's interior, and on the calibration and processing of magnetic satellite data. In 4D-Earth-Core+ I will focus on the calibration of magnetic data from satellites like Swarm, MSS-1, CryoSat-2 and others, and on improving DTU's geomagnetic field models by accounting for ionospheric, magnetospheric, and Earth-induced contributions.

>}}
I develop and use the [xshells code](https://nschaeff.bitbucket.io/xshells/index.html) to study fluid planetary interiors with magnetic fields.
In this project, we will study several key aspects of Earth's core flow related to the geomagnetic field using high performance numerical simulations.
