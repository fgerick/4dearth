| - | - | - |
| **Date** | Thursday, March 12th, 9:00 - 17:00 (GMT+0) |
| **Schedule** | See preliminary schedule below. Oral presentations, as well as posters from in-person participants with discussion. The workshop will be hosted by the ESA-funded 4D Earth core+ consortium and the British Geological Survey, and is open to all interested in detailed discussions of geomagnetism and core dynamics. |
| **Venue** | The Natural History Museum, London. |
| **Sign up form** | https://forms.cloud.microsoft/e/FBXnh1CWpG .  Remote attendance will be possible, but only in-person speakers can present. The venue has limited capacity, and we will operate on a first come first served basis. If there are places remaining, the deadline for those wishing to present is January 23rd; for those only wishing to attend and not present the deadline is February 27th. |
| **Cost** | Free to attend but food likely not included. |
