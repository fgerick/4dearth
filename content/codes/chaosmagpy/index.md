![Global map of the magnetic field](https://chaosmagpy.readthedocs.io/en/master/_images/sphx_glr_plot_global_polar_001.png "Map of the first time-derivative of the radial field component from the CHAOS geomagnetic field model on the core surface in 2016 following [the example in the documentation](https://chaosmagpy.readthedocs.io/en/master/gallery/plot_global_polar.html).")

ChaosMagPy is a simple Python package for evaluating the [CHAOS](https://www.spacecenter.dk/files/magnetic-models/CHAOS-8/index.html) geomagnetic field model and other models of Earth’s magnetic field. 
It gives a convenient interface for analysing the model, for example computing the field components on a grid, computing timeseries of Gauss coefficients, or plotting maps of the time-dependent internal field.
There is a [documentation](https://chaosmagpy.readthedocs.io) including an [example gallery](https://chaosmagpy.readthedocs.io/en/master/gallery/index.html) of different data visualizations.


The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ancklo/ChaosMagPy).
