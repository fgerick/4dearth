We provide visualisation tools for geomagnetic observations and models. Some models include surface core flows that were inverted directly from geomagnetic data, or from their interpolation through Gauss coefficients, using the radial induction equation at the core mantle boundary (see the data assimilation Python package [pygeodyn](https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Geodynamo/pygeodyn) for more details). The visualisation tools described below can also be used locally with the [webgeodyn](https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Geodynamo/webgeodyn) package (also on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/webgeodyn/)).
