The link below gives ascii files containing the selected vector and scalar satellite data (from the Swarm, CHAMP, Oersted and Cryosat-2 satellites) used in building the CHAOS-7.15 field model. These contain Swarm data up until early June 2023. The vector field is provided as components in an Earth centred, Earth fixed, spherical polar coordinate system (i.e. radial, southward, eastward components). Estimates of the crustal and external fields based on the CHAOS-7.15 model are also provide for each datum, so users interested in the core field can subtract these if wished. The file header specifies the exact content.
