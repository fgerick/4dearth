A zip file containing updated GO data files in cdf format (following the ESA GVO file specifications) with 1monthly, 4monthly and annual averaging for data based on hourly mean data from 1997 to 2023 at 218 Ground observatories (from the BGS `AUX_OBS` data product version `0136` from May 2023) can be found at:
http://www.spacecenter.dk/files/magnetic-models/GO/GO_data.zip

Each file contains the 'Observed' field (e.g. observed monthly means) and 'Core field' (e.g. revised monthly means) as well as SV derived as annual differences of the 'Core Field'. Full details of the processing of each data file and given in the file Readme_GO.txt inside the zip file.

This format has been successfully used within the consortium within the initial phase of the project e.g. by the Grenoble team. These are updated versions of the GO datasets described in the report of the initial phase of the Swarm+4D Deep Earth: Core project.

Refer to the `archived_GO_files` for earlier versions of the GO datafiles. These are labelled by version number.
